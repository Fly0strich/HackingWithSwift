# Hacking With Swift Projects

## Description
These are projects that I have completed, or  am currently working on, by following tutorials that can be found on Paul Hudson's [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) website.

## Contributing
I am aware that a lot of these projects will have flaws in them, but I will not be accepting pull requests, as I am just trying to learn the Swift programming language.
I mainly just wanted to have this repository as a way to show my code to others when I ask others for assistance  in online forums.
